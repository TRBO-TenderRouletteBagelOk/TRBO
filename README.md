Tinder like project


Tinder cards, but you swipe on hobbies and music you like or don't like.
Then you can click a button to get paired up to do a video chat with you someone you haven't see before and you can't leave for 5 minutes, and then you rate the person you just talked to. You only get 1 vid chat per day.

Have a wait-list so only the same amount of men/women are on the app.
